# forsakextras

*the script:*
**``loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allelahh/forsakextras/refs/heads/main/forsakextras.lua"))()``**
**THIS SCRIPT ONLY LETS YOU DO THINGS LIKE REPLACING LMS MUSIC, THERE IS NO ACTUAL STUFF LIKE HACKING OR SPEED CHEATS OR SMTH!**
_IMPORTANT: if you don't want me to track your username and executor and chat logs of your session (idk why i did those i just like webhooks), just set "TrackMePlease" to "false" at the start of the script. (forsakextras.lua)_

Repo for assets like audios/videos/images for a **QoL script** for the Roblox game **"Forsaken"** which __**gives no advantages**__;
and is therefore **NOT malicious** (i'm serious), and shouldn't need to be removed.
don't worry github mods, or users

## additional notes:
*- thanks ivannetta for most if not all of the file/asset downloading logic and some parts of the script about music replacement, the killer emoting gui and giving me documentation about scripting for script executors, your animation gui thingy did give me a slight stroke tho*
