# forsakextras

> A **QoL script** for the Roblox game **Forsaken**, providing features like music replacement and GUI tweaks — **nothing malicious or unfair**.

---

## 📜 The Script

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allelahh/forsakextras/refs/heads/main/forsakextras.lua"))()
```

> ⚠️ **This script does not include cheats** such as speed hacks, exploits, or anything that gives unfair advantages. It's intended solely for quality-of-life improvements, maybe even client-sided bug fixes in the future, You may request any new features in the "issues" tab if you'd like, or just report any bugs, too.

---

## 🔒 Privacy Note

By default, the script sends your username, executor, and some chat logs to a webhook (I did it mostly for fun/dev reasons).
If you'd prefer not to be tracked:

> Open `forsakextras.lua` and set:

```lua
TrackMePlease = false
```

## 📁 What’s in this Repo?

This repository stores assets (audios, videos, images) used by the script. It exists to support Forsakextras functionality.

## 🙏 Thanks

Huge thanks to **ivannetta** for:

* Music replacement logic
* Asset/file downloading code
* Killer emote GUI
* Documentation about scripting for executors

> (your animation GUI code did make my brain hurt a bit though lol)
